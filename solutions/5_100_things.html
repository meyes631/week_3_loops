  //Create a drawing that:

	// - Has 100 or more things (lines, circles, cats, snowflakes, etc)
	// - Is animated
	// - Changes when you click or move your mouse
	// You will also be graded based on your creativity and ability to do something that is different from any of the examples provided.

    //that random change their brightness.
